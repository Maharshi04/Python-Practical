#  DICTIONARY :

#  a. Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.
from typing import List


mydict = {
    1:'lion',
    2:'tiger',
    3:'rat'    
}

        print('given key is not exist in dictionary')  

print('OUTPUTS OF DICTIONARY  :  ')
print('\nOutput of a :')
existkey(2)

# b. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries

mydict = {
    1:'lion',
    2:'tiger',
    3:'rat'    
}
mydict1 = {
    'a':'dog',
    'b':'cat',
    'c':'cow'

print('\nOutput of b :')
print("first dictionary :",mydict)
print("second dictionary :",mydict1)
print("merged dictionary :",mydict2)

# c. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a dictionary.

mydict ={
     1:10,
     2:20,
     3:30
 }
 
print('\nOutput of c :')
print(sum(mydict.values())) ##sum is built-in function in python from which we can sum all the values of dictionaries  

# d. Write a Python script to add a key to a dictionary.
# Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}
# Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}

sampdict ={
    0:10,
    1:20

print('\nOutput of d :')

# e. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one.
# Sample Dictionary :
# dic1={1:10, 2:20}
# dic2={3:30, 4:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}

# TUPLES :
 
#  a. Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types.

mytuple = ("tuple",26,3.5,True) #Create a tuple with different data types

print('\n\nOUTPUT OF TUPLES  : ')

# b. Write a Python program to create a tuple with numbers and print one item.

mytuple=(10,20,30,40)
print('\nOutput of b :')
print(mytuple[2])  #print one item of tuple using index of item in tuple

# c. Write a Python program to add an item in a tuple.

mytuple=('tiger','lion','rabbit','monkey') #We can't add elements to a tuple because of their immutable property
mytuple1=list(mytuple)
mytuple1.append('dog') #adding element using append after converting into list
print('\nOutput of c :')

# d. Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a string.

mytuple=('T','I','G','E','R')
string = ''.join(mytuple) #connect element of tuple to convert into a string

# e. Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple

mytuple =(10,20,30,40)

# SET  : 
 
#  a. Write a Python program to add member(s) in a set and clear a set

# c. Write a Python program to create an intersection, Union, difference of sets.

myset ={"apple","orange","grapes","banana"}

print('\nOutput of c : ') 
print("intesection of two sets :",myset.intersection(myset1))

# d. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.

myset={10,20,30,40,70}
print('\nOutput of d : ')

# e. Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts from list, tuple, dictionary.

# most common from list
